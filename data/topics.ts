        content: "The overwhelming scientific consensus confirms that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activities. Over 97% of climate scientists agree that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main driver of current warming trends. Evidence includes rising global temperatures, melting ice sheets, sea level rise, and changing precipitation patterns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports provide comprehensive assessments showing that without immediate action, we face catastrophic consequences including extreme weather events, food insecurity, and mass displacement of populations.",

The Stern Review estimated that climate change could cost 5-20% of global GDP annually if left unchecked, while mitigation efforts would cost only 1% of GDP. Extreme weather events already cost billions in damages, affecting insurance, agriculture, and infrastructure. However, the transition to renewable energy creates new job opportunities and industries. Carbon pricing and green investments are reshaping financial markets, with ESG considerations becoming central to business strategy.",

The Paris Agreement framework aims to limit warming to 1.5Â°C through nationally determined contributions. Policy tools include carbon taxes, cap-and-trade systems, renewable energy mandates, and green building standards. Many countries are implementing net-zero emission targets, while cities lead with innovative climate policies. International cooperation on technology transfer and climate finance is crucial for developing nations.",
